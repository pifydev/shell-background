/**
 * Spawn a shell command whose output streams to a log file, cross-platform.
 *
 * The obvious trick — hand the child the file's own descriptor as stdout/stderr
 * so the kernel writes it with zero JS in the path — is POSIX-only. On Windows
 * a numeric fd in `stdio` does not inherit the way it does on Unix (measured:
 * the command exits 1 and the file stays empty), which is why the background-
 * bash extensions that use it have no Windows story. This suite supports
 * Windows, so we take the portable path: pipe stdout and stderr and write them
 * into one log file ourselves.
 *
 * Losslessness then depends on draining the pipes, which we do on every chunk,
 * and on not finalizing before the tail arrives: after the process exits we
 * wait for both pipes to end, with a short grace timer so a quiet inherited
 * handle (a Windows daemonized grandchild that never closes it) still releases.
 *
 * `detached` (POSIX) makes the child a process-group leader so its whole tree
 * can be signalled (see kill.ts); `unref` keeps a running job from holding the
 * host's event loop open. The job lives as long as the session does — it is
 * killed on shutdown, not orphaned — so pipes owned by the parent are the right
 * model. Zero dependencies: node:child_process + node:fs.

/**
 * The messages a backgrounded command produces — when it is sent to the
 * background, and when it comes back.
 *
 * Two audiences, one hard constraint. Delivery — pushing the finished result
 * into the conversation unasked — only works if the session outlives the run.
 * An interactive session does; a headless `pi -p` run tears down the moment the
 * prompt resolves, so there is nothing left to deliver into. So the not-ready
 * message tells the truth for the mode it is in: interactive can wait, headless
 * must collect within the turn.
 *
 * Pure strings; the extension owns the clock, the processes and the host.
